    <h1 id="rna-folding-algorithm">RNA Folding Algorithm</h1>
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective</strong> :- The primary goal is to develop a computational model that can accurately predict
      RNA secondary structures. This model must strictly adhere to biological and physical constraints to reflect
      realistic RNA behavior. A specific focus is on ensuring that each base pairing in the structure is separated by at
      least four intervening bases, which helps simulate natural RNA folding and function.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Constraints</strong> :-</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base Pairing Specificity</strong>: This constraint is based on the Watson-Crick base pairing rules
        where adenine (A) pairs exclusively with uracil (U), and cytosine © pairs with guanine (G). This specificity
        must be strictly enforced in the model to maintain biological accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Intervening Base Requirement</strong>: To prevent the RNA molecule from forming unrealistically sharp
        turns, there must be at least four intervening bases between each pair. This constraint ensures the physical
        feasibility of the RNA structure and is crucial for simulating realistic molecular dynamics.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-overlapping</strong>: Each nucleotide in the RNA sequence can only be part of one base pair. This
        rule prevents the formation of complex and biologically impossible structures where a base might otherwise
        engage in multiple pairings.</li>
      <li><strong>No Knots</strong>: The RNA structure should not form any physical knots. Ensuring that the structure
        is knot-free is essential for its biological functionality and for simplifying computational modeling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Input</strong> :- The algorithm takes an RNA string as input. RNA strings consist of characters from the
      alphabet {A, U, C, G}, representing the bases Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine, and Guanine respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Output</strong> :- Return the structure set with the start and end indices of all pairs, representing the
      secondary structure.</p>

      <li>
        <p>Initialise the dynamic programming vector(opt) whenever <strong>i&gt;= j - 4</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>(No sharp turns) The ends of each pair are separated by at least 4 intervening bases i.e. if (i , j) ε S,
            then i &lt; j - 4.</li>
          <li>The elements in each pair in S consist of either {A,U} or {C,G} (in either order).</li>
          <li>S is a matching: no base appears in more than one pair.</li>
          <li>(No knots) If (i,j) and (k,l) are two pairs in S, then we can’t have i &lt; k &lt; j &lt; l</li>

          than one.<br>

          Analysis :-
        <p>
          The secondary structure is represented by a series of base pairs in zero-indexed format (i, j), where i and j
          are the indices of the paired bases.
          The given base pairs are:

          (0, 30) indicating the first base G is paired with the 31st base C.
          (1, 29) indicating the second base G is paired with the 30th base A.
          Other pairs follow this pattern with the corresponding indices provided.

          A thorough analysis would involve verifying the consistency between the text output and the graphical
          representation:

          Each pair in the text output should correspond to a line connecting two bases in the graphical structure.
          The unpaired bases in the graphical structure should not be part of any pair in the text output.

          Analysis :-
        <p>
          Comparing both images, we can cross-reference the base pairs given in the textual output with the graphical
          representation to verify the accuracy of the prediction. For instance, if (0,26) is listed as a base pair, we
          should see a line connecting the first and the last bases in the graphical representation, indicating a stem.

          <img src="3_.png" alt="enter image description here"><br>
          Analysis :-
        <p>
          Consistency is confirmed by matching each base pair in the textual output to the lines connecting bases in the
          graphical image. For example, the first pair (0,27) should connect the first C with the last G in the
          graphical representation.
          We should verify that the base pairs follow the canonical A-U and G-C rules without any mismatches or
          non-canonical pairs unless the model allows for wobble base pairing (G-U pairs).
          The structure's stability can be assessed by the number and continuity of the base pairs in the stem regions.
          More continuous base pairs typically indicate a more stable secondary structure.

          Analysis :-
        <p>
          A list of base pairings in the secondary structure, given in a zero-indexed format (i, j), where i is the
          position of the first base in the pair and j is the position of the second base:
          For example, (0, 26) indicates the first nucleotide U is paired with the 27th nucleotide A.
          The other pairs listed follow this pattern, such as (1, 24) indicating the second nucleotide C is paired with
          the 25th nucleotide G.
          The pairs listed in the textual output should correspond to the pairs shown in the graphical representation.
          Each line connecting two bases in the diagram should match a pair in the list.
          The graphical structure should not show any base paired in a way that contradicts the list. For example, the
          first U should only be paired with the A at position 27, not with any other nucleotide.

          <img src="5_.png" alt="enter image description here"><br>
          Analysis :-
        <p>
          To analyze the consistency, we should verify that each base pair listed in the text output is correctly
          illustrated in the graphical representation. For example, (0,17) should show the first U connected to the A at
          position 18, if we are considering a zero-indexed sequence.
          The pattern of base pairing should reflect allowed biological pairings (A-U and G-C) and maintain the minimum
          distance rule where applicable. It's important to note that the four-base rule mentioned earlier may not be
          applicable to this particular analysis if the model or algorithm does not enforce this specific constraint.
          Stability of the structure can be inferred from the number of base pairs in the stem regions; more paired
          bases generally indicate a more stable structure.
          The algorithm's output can be compared with established databases of RNA secondary structures or predictions
          from other established algorithms to ensure the results are within expected parameters.

          implies that the time taken to predict the secondary structure grows exponentially with the length of the RNA
          sequence.<br>
          For large RNA sequences, this complexity may lead to impractical computation times, making the algorithm
          inefficient for real-world applications. It may not be feasible to predict structures for long RNA sequences
          within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

        <p><strong>Scalability</strong> :- The algorithm’s scalability for very large RNA sequences needs to be
          investigated to ensure it can handle real-world data efficiently. As the size of RNA sequences commonly
          encountered in biological datasets continues to increase, it’s essential that the algorithm can scale
          appropriately to handle these larger inputs without sacrificing performance or accuracy.</p>
